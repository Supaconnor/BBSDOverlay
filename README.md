# BeatKhanaOverlay

Its a mess, Layers and layers upon bandaid fixes. Working on a rewrite but no time for that yet.
Keep in mind that the TaToken given here is only functional in the testing enviornment and should be replaced for the real tournament.

This overlay was forked from https://github.com/kasper201/BeatKhanaOverlay and made standalone.
